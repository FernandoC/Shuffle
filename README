Description: The Shuffle program reads in permutations
             from a file. It then makes a default list and applies
             the permutations to it. It repeats this process until it
             reverts back to its default state and prints out how many
             iterations it took to do so.

Compiling Instructions: Download all the files and type "make" in SSH

Files Submitted: List.c, List.h, ListTest.c, Shuffle.c, Makefile, and README

List.c:        Contains the doubly linked List ADT and all its functions.

List.h:        Contains all the functions names in List.c to be used in Shuffle.c

ListTest.c:    Contains a program that uses the List ADT to make sure everything
               is in order by calling all of its functions. 

Shuffle.c:     Reads in a file and creats a List of permutations. 
               It then applies this permutation to a normal List. It does this
               until the List is back to normal and prints out the order or 
               amount of iterations it took to get back to normal. 

Makefile:      Compiles everything and makes the Shuffle program into a jar file.

README:        The title serves its purpose.
